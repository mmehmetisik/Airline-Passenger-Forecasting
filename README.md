# Airline-Passenger-Forecasting
In this project, we adopted an end-to-end approach using time series analysis techniques to forecast the future passenger numbers of an airline company. 
Our study leverages a dataset that captures monthly total airline passenger counts starting from 1949, aiming to provide accurate predictions for future demands.
